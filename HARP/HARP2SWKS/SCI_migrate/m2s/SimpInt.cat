This function performs numerical integration via the Simpsons's method.
Input:     Vector1: vector of the "x" values to be integrated over
           Vector2: vector of the "y(x)" values 
           a: index value of Vector1 to begin the integration
           b: index value of Vector1 to end the integration

Output:    Output: scalar, the integral of Vector2 over the interval
                   Vector1 from a to b
