Evaluates fitness function and returns the fitness value
Inputs: PvsV: a two column vector, first column is the flow speeds, second column is the power values
        pUvars: vector which contains the appropriate variables needed for the selected probability distribution, pUvars  is defined in Main.m
        Torque: vector, the torque values
        
Output: F: scalar, the fitness value
